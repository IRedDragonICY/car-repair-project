## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a vulnerability, here are the steps you should follow:

1. **Do not** open an issue on GitHub. This will make the vulnerability public, and we want to prevent malicious users from exploiting it before we have a chance to fix it.

2. Send an email to our security team at 2200018401@webmail.uad.ac.id. Include as much information as possible about the vulnerability, including steps to reproduce it, its potential impact, and your suggested fix if you have one.

3. Wait for a response. We will try to respond to your report within 48 hours. We will then work to understand and reproduce the issue.

4. Once we have confirmed the vulnerability, we will work on a fix and release it as soon as possible. We will also publicly acknowledge your contribution unless you request to remain anonymous.

Your responsible disclosure of security vulnerabilities helps us ensure the safety and privacy of our users. Thank you for your help!
